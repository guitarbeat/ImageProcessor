    "explanation": r"""
    The Non-Local Means (NLM) algorithm denoises each pixel by replacing it with a 
    weighted average of pixels from a search window. The weights are based on the 
    similarity of patches around each pixel:

    1. For each pixel $(x,y)$, compare its patch $P_{{{x},{y}}}$ to patches $P_{{i,j}}$ 
       around other pixels $(i,j)$ in the search window $\Omega_{{{x},{y}}}$.
    2. Calculate a weight $w_{{{x},{y}}}(i,j)$ for each comparison based on patch similarity.
    3. Compute the NLM value $NLM_{{{x},{y}}}$ as a weighted average of intensities $I_{{i,j}}$
       using these weights, normalized by $C_{{{x},{y}}}$.

    This process replaces the original intensity $I_{{{x},{y}}} = {original_value:d}$ with the NLM value $NLM_{{{x},{y}}} = {nlm_value:d}$.
    The normalization factor $C_{{{x},{y}}}$ ensures the final weighted average preserves overall image brightness.

To avoid boundary issues, the algorithm only processes pixels within the valid region, which excludes pixels near the image border.

For a pixel at position $(x,y)$:
- The patch $P_{{x,y}}$ is defined using the kernel size {kernel_size} × {kernel_size}
- The valid processing region is determined by the kernel size:
  - Valid region: [{half_kernel}, {image_height} - {half_kernel}) × [{half_kernel}, {image_width} - {half_kernel})
  - Valid region size: {valid_height} × {valid_width}

The patch is constructed by considering pixels within the range $[-{half_kernel}, {half_kernel}]$ relative to the current pixel position.

The weight $w(x,y,i,j)$ for pixel $(i,j)$ when denoising $(x,y)$ is calculated using a Gaussian function:

- $P_{{x,y}}$, $P_{{i,j}}$: Patches centered at $(x,y)$ and $(i,j)$
- $|P_{{x,y}} - P_{{i,j}}|^2$: Sum of squared differences between patches
- $h = {filter_strength:.2f}$: Filtering parameter controlling the decay of the weights
  - Larger $h$ includes more dissimilar patches, leading to stronger smoothing
  - Smaller $h$ restricts to very similar patches, preserving more details

Similar patches yield higher weights, while dissimilar patches are assigned lower weights.
